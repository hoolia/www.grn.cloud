# wordpress
Wordpress docker image.
Does not fiddle with mysql databases, stays within its wordpress-app scope. Therefore assumes a mysql database is created out-of-scope and should just be referenced to.

# Setup

```
oc project openshift
oc new-build https://github.com/hoolia/wordpress.git
```

# Disaster recovery

```
vi examples/mysql-restore.yaml
oc create -f examples/mysql-restore.yaml
```
